# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

SecuX Cyber Athena is an educational project designed to demonstrate enterprise-grade Bitcoin multi-signature wallet security with hardware security modules (HSM) and FIDO2 authentication. While this project implements robust security practices, it is primarily intended for educational purposes and learning blockchain security concepts.

## üéØ Security Scope

### In Scope
- **Authentication & Authorization**: FIDO2/WebAuthn implementation, JWT handling
- **Input Validation**: API parameter validation, form data sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection, brute force prevention
- **Database Security**: SQL injection prevention, data validation
- **Cryptographic Operations**: Multi-signature wallet operations, key management
- **HSM Integration**: Hardware security module interactions
- **Session Management**: Authentication state handling
- **API Security**: Endpoint protection, request validation

### Out of Scope
- **Infrastructure Security**: Server configuration, network security
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in external libraries (reported separately)
- **Browser Security**: Client-side browser vulnerabilities
- **Hardware Security**: Physical security of HSM devices

### Security Audit Areas
```typescript
// Example: Input validation patterns
const UserInputSchema = z.object({
  accountId: z.string().min(3).max(50),
  passphraseHash: z.string().regex(/^[a-f0-9]{64}$/),
});

// Security consideration: Always validate inputs
const validatedInput = UserInputSchema.parse(userInput);
```
