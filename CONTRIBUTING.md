## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use proper types and interfaces
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing linting rules (`npm run lint`)
- **Formatting**: Code will be automatically formatted on commit
- **Comments**: Add educational comments explaining complex concepts
- **Security**: Never commit secrets or credentials

### Commit Message Format

Use descriptive commit messages that follow this pattern:
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(auth): add FIDO2 credential management
fix(wallet): resolve multi-signature validation bug
docs(api): improve Swagger documentation
refactor(ui): extract reusable form components
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow code standards and add tests where appropriate
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Ensure all existing tests pass

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   npm run lint          # Check code quality
   npm run build         # Verify build succeeds
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(component): add new feature"
   ```

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] **Clear Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- [ ] **Educational Value**: Ensure changes improve learning opportunities
- [ ] **Security Review**: All security-related changes must be reviewed
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Pass all linting and formatting checks
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
- [ ] **Testing**: Verify functionality works as expected

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
- Test all authentication flows (FIDO2 registration/login)
- Verify multi-signature wallet creation and operations
- Test form validation and error handling
- Check responsive design on different devices

### Security Testing
- Validate all input fields with edge cases
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Verify JWT token handling
- Check for potential XSS or injection vulnerabilities

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 67+ (WebAuthn support)
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 18+

## üìñ Educational Contribution Guidelines

Since this is an educational project, special attention should be paid to:

### Code Comments
- Explain **why** not just **what**
- Include security considerations
- Reference relevant standards (WebAuthn, Bitcoin, etc.)
- Provide context for complex algorithms

### Documentation
- Use clear, accessible language
- Include practical examples
- Link to relevant external resources
- Explain security implications

### Examples
```typescript
/**
 * Validates a Bitcoin address using Base58Check encoding
 *
 * Bitcoin addresses use Base58Check encoding to prevent transcription errors
 * and include a checksum for integrity verification. This validation ensures
 * the address is properly formatted before attempting transactions.
 *
 * @param address - Bitcoin address to validate
 * @returns true if address is valid, false otherwise
 *
 * Security Note: Always validate addresses before creating transactions
 * to prevent loss of funds due to invalid destinations.
 */
function validateBitcoinAddress(address: string): boolean {
  // Implementation with educational comments...
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue**
2. **Email security concerns** to the maintainers privately
3. **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Allow time for assessment** before public disclosure

### Security Review Process
All security-related contributions will undergo additional review:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Cryptographic implementations
- Rate limiting and DoS protection

## üåü Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in several ways:
- **GitHub Contributions**: Automatically tracked in repository
- **README Recognition**: Major contributors featured in README
- **Release Notes**: Contributions mentioned in release notes
- **Learning Community**: Help build a valuable educational resource

## üìû Getting Help

### Questions and Discussion
- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
